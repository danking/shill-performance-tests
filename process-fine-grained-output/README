You should copy these scripts into the directory containing the data
and then run them there. They expect their depedent scripts to be
located in the `$CWD`.

If you have `info.i` and `log.i` files then calling `bash process.sh`
will produce a `results` folder containing `summary.i` and `result.i`
files. The summary contains values generated once a run, like vm start
up time. The result contains the exec, grepfun, and shill-sandbox
statistics.
